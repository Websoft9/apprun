## 🔄 Workflow Relationship

### **1. PRD → Epics → Stories**
- **PRD** defines "what to build" (product vision)
- **Epics** break down PRD into business features
- **Stories** decompose Epics into implementable tasks

### **2. Stories → Sprints**
- **Sprints** group Stories into 2-week iterations
- Each Sprint delivers working software

### **3. Standards → Implementation**
- **Standards** define "how to build" (technical guidelines)
- Standards are **implemented during Sprints** through Stories
- Example: `standards/api-design.md` → Sprint-0 Story 1 (Response Package)
